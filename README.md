# maze-game
I made a simple maze game for others to enjoy playing and to display HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Running the web app and using the up, down, left, and right arrows to move the player.

More changes and updates will be made in the future to showcase more skills.

Until then, I hope you enjoy!
