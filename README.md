# Reason for making
If you view the "domi-board-game-practice", you can read the README.md and see that each student was given an assignment to build a game to display on GitHub.

# maze-game
I made a simple maze game for others to enjoy playing and to display HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation skills.

Running the web app and using the up, down, left, and right arrows to move the player.

More changes and updates will be made in the future to showcase more skills.

Until then, I hope you enjoy!
