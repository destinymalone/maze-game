# maze-game

I've designed a simple maze game for others to enjoy and to display HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation skills.

Run the web app and use the ,up-down-left-right, arrows to move the player.

More changes and updates could be made in the future to showcase newly learned skills.

Until then, I hope you enjoy!
